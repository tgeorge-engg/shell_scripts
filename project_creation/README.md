#Creating C++ Projects

The script cpp_create.sh creates directories for a new C++ project. The structure is as follows:

PROJECT_NAME  
└── include  
└── lib  
└── src  
&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── include  
&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── modules  
&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── main.cpp  
└── makefile  

The script allows you to specify the project name as well as the parent directory the project is stored in.
